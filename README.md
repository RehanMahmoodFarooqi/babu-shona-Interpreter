# babu-shona-Interpreter
make our own language that starts with babu and ends with shona. we have worked on variables, conditional statements and loops. As this is the programming language for the beginners who are passionate to dive into coding so we have developed that to help those students. this project has been made by me as a semester project of the CC course
